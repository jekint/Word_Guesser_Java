# Word_Guesser_Java
Wordle-like game written using Java.

This is a word guessing game in which there is a secret word that can be anywhere between 4-6 letters long. You must try guessing the 4-6 letter word by typing in a 4-6 letter word. If your input word has a letter in the same exact position as the secret word, then that will count as a Rock and a R will show up under your input word. If your input word has a letter that is in the secret word but not in the same position, then that will count as a Pebble and a P will show up under your input word.
